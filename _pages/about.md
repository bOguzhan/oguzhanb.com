Hello, I'm Oguzhan, and I have a deep love for product management and the intricacies of bringing great ideas to life.

Currently, I'm fortunate to be wearing two hats in the startup world. At Game Factory, I work as a Product Manager, contributing to the development and launch of new solutions and programs. It's an exciting space to be in, surrounded by a team of dedicated individuals.

Additionally, I'm also an Operations Manager at SKILLED, an education startup where I have the privilege of being a part of a team that strives to deliver impactful learning experiences.

In my spare time, I'm getting myself ready to join the figurative kitchen of the gaming industry. I'm in the process of learning the art of game development, driven by a desire to understand the craft from the ground up. I'm open to contributing to projects on the side during my weekends, eager to collaborate with fellow enthusiasts and bring new visions to life.

I'm always open to conversations about product strategy, operational efficiency, or anything related to startups. If you're interested in collaborating, sharing insights, or exploring potential synergies, feel free to reach out. I'm here to connect and learn from others in this vibrant community.

Thank you for visiting my corner of the web, and I look forward to the possibility of connecting with you. 

Oguzhan
